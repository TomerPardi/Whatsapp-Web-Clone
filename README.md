# Web Client Implementation - Chats App
## General
- This is the **first part** of a four-part project.
- This implementation is not suppurted by web server but by **"Hard-coded" arrays**.
- It's written as part of an project we asked to make in _Advanced Programming_ course at Bar Ilan University.
- Authors: **Daniel Bronfman** (ID: 315901173) & **Tomer Pardilov** (ID: 316163922).

## Logic
We implemented **three main pages**:
- **Login page**: The user is asked to insert username and password, both are required.
- **Registration page**: The user is asked to insert username, nickname, password and image. All are required and only alphanumeric pattern is accepted.
- **Chats page**: Here we can see user's contacts list and the conversations he has with them.
